    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggplants</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil (vegetable or canola)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tomato, finely chopped (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Eggplants:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Grilling Method:</strong> Preheat your grill to medium-high
            heat. Place the eggplants directly on the grill grates and cook for
            about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred
            and the flesh is soft.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Boiling Method:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil.
            Carefully add the eggplants and cook for about 10-15 minutes, or
            until tender. Remove and let them cool.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peel and Prepare the Eggplants:</strong> After grilling or
        boiling, let the eggplants cool enough to handle. Peel off the skin. The
        flesh should be soft and mushy. Flatten each eggplant by gently pressing
        it with a fork or the back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Egg Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs.
        Season with salt, pepper, and optional garlic powder and onion powder.
        If using onions and tomatoes, mix them into the beaten eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dipping and Cooking:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Heat the cooking oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
          <li>
            Dip each flattened eggplant into the egg mixture, ensuring it is
            well-coated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the coated eggplant into the hot skillet. Cook for about 3-4
            minutes on each side, or until the egg is golden brown and cooked
            through.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving:</strong> Remove the cooked Tortang Talong from the
        skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
        Serve hot with steamed rice and a dipping sauce made from vinegar,
        minced garlic, and a pinch of salt.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>For a heartier version:</strong> Add a filling of ground meat
        (pork, beef, or chicken) mixed with onions, tomatoes, and seasoning
        before dipping the eggplant in the egg mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dipping Sauce:</strong> You can also serve Tortang Talong with a
        side of soy sauce or a tomato-based dipping sauce for extra flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>For extra crispiness:</strong> Let the coated eggplant sit for a
        few minutes before frying to allow the egg to set and create a crispier
        texture.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Enjoy your delicious Tortang Talong, a comforting and flavorful Filipino
      classic!
