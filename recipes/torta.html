          most delicious egg dishes around, according to Taste Atlas. This
          scrumptious eggplant omelette is simple yet incredibly satisfying. The

          fan of egg dishes or just love trying new flavors, Tortang Talong is
          definitely a must-try. Its combination of smoky eggplant and fluffy
          egg is pure comfort food bliss!

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Eggplants:</strong> Grill or boil the
            eggplants until they are tender and the skin is charred (if grilling)
            or soft (if boiling). Let them cool slightly, then peel off the skin
            and mash the flesh with a fork.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Egg Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs
            and season with salt and pepper. You can also add finely chopped
            onion and tomato if you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine:</strong> Mix the mashed eggplant into the egg
            mixture until well combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook:</strong> Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour
            a portion of the eggplant-egg mixture into the skillet and spread it
            out to form a round omelette. Cook until the bottom is golden brown,
            then flip and cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the Tortang Talong hot with rice, or
            as a standalone dish with a side of ketchup or hot sauce.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Grilling Eggplants:</strong> For extra flavor, grill the
            eggplants until the skin is charred. This gives a nice smoky taste to
            the dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adding Ingredients:</strong> Feel free to add other
            ingredients like ground meat or cheese to the egg mixture for a
            different twist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cooking Heat:</strong> Make sure the skillet is properly
            heated before adding the egg mixture to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Serving Ideas:</strong> Tortang Talong can be served with a
            side of garlic rice and a fresh tomato salad for a complete meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> Leftovers can be stored in the fridge and
            reheated for a quick meal.
