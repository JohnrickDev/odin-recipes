    <ol>
      <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) chicken thighs or pork shoulder, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vinegar (white or apple cider)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1 head garlic, peeled and crushed</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the chicken or pork pieces, soy sauce, and
        garlic. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight for better flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinated meat (reserve the marinade) to the skillet and cook
        until browned on all sides.

      <li>Pour in the reserved marinade, water, and vinegar. Do not stir.</li>
      <li>Add the black peppercorns and bay leaves. Bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it simmer
        for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the meat is tender.
      </li>
      <li>For a sweeter taste, add the brown sugar and stir to combine.</li>

        Optional: Add the potatoes during the last 15 minutes of cooking and
        cook until they are tender.
      </li>

        Remove the lid and simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, allowing
