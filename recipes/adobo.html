    <h1>Adobo Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
      Adobo is one of the most iconic dishes in Filipino cuisine and for good
      reason. It's a savory, tangy, and slightly sweet stew that's packed with
      flavor. Made with chicken, pork, or even both, it's simmered in a mixture
      of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves until it's
      melt-in-your-mouth tender. Adobo is incredibly versatile and has earned
      its spot as a favorite comfort food in the Philippines and beyond.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs chicken pieces (legs or thighs work best)</li>
      <li>1 lb pork belly, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vinegar (white or apple cider)</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the soy
        sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. Add the chicken and pork pieces,
        making sure they're well-coated. Cover and let it marinate in the fridge
        for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for more flavor).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Meat:</strong> Heat the cooking oil in a large pot or
        Dutch oven over medium heat. Remove the meat from the marinade and cook
        it in the pot until it's browned on all sides. You might need to do this
        in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer:</strong> Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook until
        softened. Pour in the remaining marinade and water. Stir to combine.
        Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer
        for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is tender and the
        sauce has thickened. If you like a slightly sweet adobo, add the brown
        sugar to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season:</strong> Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with
        salt and pepper as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the adobo hot with steamed rice. Enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Balance the flavors:</strong> Adjust the amount of soy sauce and
        vinegar to suit your taste. Some like it more tangy, while others prefer
        it saltier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use coconut milk:</strong> For a creamy variation, add a can of
        coconut milk to the pot during the simmering stage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add potatoes:</strong> Adding cubed potatoes can make the dish
        more hearty and absorb the delicious sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make ahead:</strong> Adobo tastes even better the next day, so
        feel free to make it ahead of time and store it in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Experiment with spices:</strong> Some variations include adding
        whole peppercorns, bay leaves, or even a touch of chili for a bit of
        heat.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Adobo is a dish that gets even better the next day, so don't be surprised
      if you find yourself craving leftovers!
