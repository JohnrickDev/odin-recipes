      <p class="intro-text">
        Adobo is one of the most iconic dishes in Filipino cuisine and for good
        reason. It's a savory, tangy, and slightly sweet stew that's packed with
        flavor. Made with chicken, pork, or even both, it's simmered in a
        mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves until it's
        melt-in-your-mouth tender. Adobo is incredibly versatile and has earned
        its spot as a favorite comfort food in the Philippines and beyond.

        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vinegar (white or apple cider)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)</li>

      <h2 class="instructions-title">Instructions:</h2>
      <ol class="instructions-ol">
        <li>
          <strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the soy
          sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. Add the chicken and pork
          pieces, making sure they're well-coated. Cover and let it marinate in
          the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for more flavor).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the Meat:</strong> Heat the cooking oil in a large pot or
          Dutch oven over medium heat. Remove the meat from the marinade and
          cook it in the pot until it's browned on all sides. You might need to
          do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simmer:</strong> Add the chopped onion to the pot and cook
          until softened. Pour in the remaining marinade and water. Stir to
          combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let
          it simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is tender
          and the sauce has thickened. If you like a slightly sweet adobo, add
          the brown sugar to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Season:</strong> Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with
          salt and pepper as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the adobo hot with steamed rice. Enjoy!
        </li>

    <div class="tips">
      <h2 class="tips-title">Tips:</h2>
      <ul class="tips-ul">
        <li>
          <strong>Balance the flavors:</strong> Adjust the amount of soy sauce
          and vinegar to suit your taste. Some like it more tangy, while others
          prefer it saltier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use coconut milk:</strong> For a creamy variation, add a can
          of coconut milk to the pot during the simmering stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add potatoes:</strong> Adding cubed potatoes can make the dish
          more hearty and absorb the delicious sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make ahead:</strong> Adobo tastes even better the next day, so
          feel free to make it ahead of time and store it in the fridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experiment with spices:</strong> Some variations include
          adding whole peppercorns, bay leaves, or even a touch of chili for a
          bit of heat.
        </li>
      </ul>
